# CSGames Problems

This repository contains 12 problems used for a competitive competition held by our computer science club every semester. This problem set was used in the Spring 2021 games, they are available here for interested users to solve on their own.

The competition is designed for 4 rounds, each round lasting 15 minutes, allowing teams of up to 3 students. Answers to questions from previous rounds are still accepted after the next round's questions are released. These questions are aimed such that a freshman in computer science can reasonably understand and solve the problem, but shortcuts may be available for upperclassmen who have more knowledge about the subject.
