# Easy 3: Rotation Cipher

A rotation cipher takes a message and scrambles it by shifting each letter by an amount. The amount is determined by the corresponding letter in the key. If the letter in the key is A, it shifts by 0, B by 1, C by 2, etc. If the shifting is past Z, it wraps around the alphabet. This key is the same length as the message.

Message:

`MYSECRET`

Ciphertext:

`NMJSYJOB`

What is the key?

### Solution

`BOROWSKI`
