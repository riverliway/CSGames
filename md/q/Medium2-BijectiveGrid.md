# Medium 2: Bijective Grid

A bijective function is one that produces a unique output for every input. We have provided a snippet of python code which implements a bijective function named “transform” operating on a 2D grid of letters. The output of the function has been saved and stored in the “output” variable, but the input to the function was overwritten with Xs.

[Python Snippet](../../resources/bijective_grid.py)

Compute the inverse of the transform function and feed it the output to get the input.
